WARNING: Architecture requirement possibly not met: Python is x86_64 but JVM requires amd64
INFO: Installing jpy...
ERROR: The module 'jpy' is required to run snappy, but no binary 'jpy' wheel matching the pattern
'jpy-{version}-cp310-{abi_tag}-linux_x86_64.whl' could be found.
You can try to build a 'jpy' wheel yourself, then copy it into
"/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/snappy", and then run the configuration again.
Unzip the jpy sources in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/snappy/jpy-<version>.zip, then
  $ cd jpy-<version>
  $ python setup.py bdist_wheel
  $ cp dist/*.whl "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/snappy"
Or get the source code from https://github.com/bcdev/jpy and follow the build instructions:
  $ git clone https://github.com/bcdev/jpy.git
  $ cd jpy
ERROR: Configuration failed with exit code 10
